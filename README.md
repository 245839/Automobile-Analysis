# Automobile-Analysis
This project involves **data analysis of automobiles**, focusing on vehicle specifications, insurance risk ratings, and normalized loss values. The goal is to explore trends, identify patterns, and extract meaningful insights from the dataset.  

## Dataset Overview  
The dataset consists of three main types of information:
- **Vehicle Specifications** – Various characteristics such as make, body style, engine type, fuel system, horsepower, and more.  
- **Insurance Risk Rating** – A "symboling" score indicating the vehicle's risk level.
- **Normalized Losses** – The relative average insurance loss per vehicle per year, adjusted for different car categories (e.g., sports cars, station wagons).

## Project Objectives & Methodology  
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Handling missing values and standardizing formats.  
- **Feature Engineering** – Splitting features into **numerical** and **categorical** variables.  
- **Data Visualization** – Creating visual representations of key dataset insights.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Investigating distributions, correlations, and patterns.  
- **Predictive Modeling** – Implementing two machine learning models:  
  -- Linear Regression
  -- Random Forest
- **Hyperparameter Optimization** – Fine-tuning RF model to enhance performance.

## How to View & Run the Project
To run this project, you will need:  
- **Python 3.x** with required libraries installed.  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Recommended) or another editor that supports `.ipynb` files.
